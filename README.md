# Conway's Game of Life

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Lua for the [TIC-80 fantasy console](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80).

Rules, from Wikipedia:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
